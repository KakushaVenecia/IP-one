    <h2>About me</h2>
    <p>Hello there!</p>
    <p> I am happy that you are here. Thank you for taking the time to stop by and check out what I am all about. My
        name is Venecia Kakusha. Most people call me Ven, Venee or Kakusha. I prefer <strong>Kakusha</strong>
        If my epitaph should read anything, it should be she tried everything. I am an indivisual who gives herself chances to fail, to try, to regroup and pick myself up. I love what I am doing currently, which is learning software development. Most times, I feel like it is baptisim by fire, but I get around some how thanks to the community at <a href="https://moringaschool.com/"><b>Moringa School.</b></a>
  I hope to be a really dope programmer that has mastered her craft but is more than happy to learn and keep up with industry insights. 
  </p>
  <h2>Hobbies and Skills</h2>
  <p>I love playing board games like scrabble and puzzles during my free time. I also enjoy attending concerts that have Kenyan Artists. I believe they have so much to offer.</p>
