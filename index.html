    <h2>About me</h2>
    <p>Hello there!</p>
    <p> I am happy that you are here. Thank you for taking the time to stop by and check out what I am all about and what I do. My
        name is Venecia Kakusha. Most people call me Ven, Venee or Kakusha. I prefer <strong>Kakusha</strong>. I have a background in Economics and Statistics.
        If my epitaph should read anything, it should be, 'She tried everything'. I am an individual who gives herself chances to fail, to try, to regroup and pick myself up. I love what I am doing currently, which is learning software development. Most times, I feel like it is baptisim by fire, but I get around some how thanks to the community at <a href="https://moringaschool.com/"><b>Moringa School.</b></a>
  I hope to be a really dope programmer that has mastered her craft but is more than happy to learn and keep up with industry insights. 
  </p>
  <h2>Hobbies and Skills</h2>
  <p>I love playing board games like scrabble and puzzles during my free time. I also enjoy attending concerts that have Kenyan Artists. I believe they have so much to offer.I am good at organising projects and am looking to explore this more in all facets</p>
  <h2>Projects</h2>
  <p>Here are some of the <em>projects </em> I have done in the not so near past
        <ul>
            <li> This is a place where you can find new ideas and classic advice on strategy, innovation and leadership, 
                for global leaders from the world's best business and management experts. <a href="https://harvardreview.org/"> Havard Reviews</a> The reviews are refreshing to read and a breath of fresh air if you are looking for new perspectives</li>
            <li> Whoever you are, at <a href="https://www.netflix.com/ke/"> Netflix</a> you are guaranteed  that there is something for everyone, for the mood you are in and the season you are in.</li>
            <li> Our team feels honored to have worked in the nutrition & food security sector over the last 6 years & hope that the contributions made by
                <a href="https://www.fantaproject.org/">Fanta</a> who continue to contribute to improvements in nutrition & foodsecurity for years to come.</li>
            <li> Well, that's not really all, it would be churlish to just say that and leave off. 
                After all, summer fragrances vary widely in quality and utility. Sometimes it's a classic like Cool Water, sometimes 
                it's a total flop like Versace Man Eau Fraiche. <a href="https://global.tommy.com/"> Tommy</a> is somewhere in the middle: 
                it's not bad by any means; in fact, it's quite nice. 
                But it's not an instant classic either.</li>
            <li> Behind the company is a beautiful history of families, friendship and the power of will uniting to create Kenya's leading, independently owned, exceptional breed of hotels and resorts.
                As a historic part of Kenya's hospitality industry, over decades we have acquired a portfolio of exceptional properties. <a href="https://www.sarovahotels.com">Sarova Hotels</a> houses seven unique properties in prime locations, each harmoniously individual to its own history and environment, 
                fortified by a vision to impact surrounding communities and build a sustainable future.</li>
        </ul>
